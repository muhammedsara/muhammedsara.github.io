### Project Overview  
The **FourPlusOne** team participated in the **OpenZeka MARC competition**, developing a **mini autonomous driving system** capable of navigating complex tracks. The system integrated **lane tracking (CNN), traffic sign detection (YOLO), and LIDAR-based obstacle detection**.  

### Key Features
- **Deep Learning**: CNN for lane tracking, YOLO for traffic sign recognition.  
- **Sensor Fusion**: LIDAR + camera for robust perception.  
- **SLAM & Localization**: ROS-based mapping and navigation pipeline.  
- **Edge Deployment**: Optimized on **NVIDIA Jetson TX2** with TensorFlow, OpenCV, and ROS.  

This project demonstrated the potential of **autonomous driving systems** in constrained embedded platforms, and received recognition in the MARC competition.

abstract: |
  Increasing air pollution with our developing world affects our lives negatively.  
  This thesis proposes a cross-data analytics approach to estimate air quality from PM10 concentrations and meteorological information.  
  Using datasets from Asian regions and the MediaEval "Insight for Wellbeing" benchmark, multiple machine learning models were examined and results were visualized to infer regional air quality indices.

summary: "M.Sc. Thesis on air quality prediction using cross-data analytics, PM10 concentrations, and meteorological data."

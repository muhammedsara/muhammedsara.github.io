As part of the **KOUSTECH UAV Team**, I contributed to the development of an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle that represented Turkey at the **AUVSI Student Unmanned Aerial Systems (SUAS) Competition 2019** in the United States.  

### Contributions
- Designed and implemented an **Autonomous Flight Control Algorithm** for stable navigation.  
- Developed **Object Detection, Classification, and Localization** modules using computer vision and deep learning.  
- Built a **Path Planning Algorithm** enabling mission-oriented autonomous decision-making.  
- Participated in **system integration, testing, and international field trials**.

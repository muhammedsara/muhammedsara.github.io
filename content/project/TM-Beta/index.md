### Project Overview
As part of the **TÜBİTAK Electric Vehicle Racing initiative**, I developed the **TM-Elektromobil-PC**, a **C# console application** that interfaces with electric vehicle hardware for race telemetry, command input, and real-time status updates. The interface enabled seamless communication with race systems, providing diagnostics and control during test runs.

### Key Features
- **Console-Based UI**: Lightweight and responsive C# command-line interface for real-time telemetry and command input.
- **Hardware Communication**: Facilitated serial/real-time communication protocols with vehicle telemetry systems.
- **Race Readiness**: Enabled testing and debugging in the field with clear feedback loops.
- **Embedded Performance**: Optimized resource usage suitable for embedded platforms used in electric race vehicles.

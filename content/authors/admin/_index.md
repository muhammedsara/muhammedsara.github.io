## About Me

Iâ€™m a software engineer with over 7 years of experience in **computer vision, artificial intelligence, and embedded systems**, holding an MSc in Information Systems Engineering from Kocaeli University and currently pursuing a PhD on **AI- and IoT-based disaster response platforms**.  
My expertise spans **autonomous systems, real-time video analytics, and edge computing**, with a strong focus on building reliable, production-grade solutions.  

On the engineering side, I specialize in **end-to-end system design**â€”from **data acquisition** (mobile/IoT sensors, IMU, video streams) to **model development and optimization** (PyTorch/TensorFlow, TensorRT, quantization) and **secure deployment** (Docker, CI/CD, cloud services). I am passionate about **R&D and innovation**, and I aim to apply advanced technologies to create scalable solutions that have real-world impact.

### Project Overview  
The **KURTAR Project** aims to revolutionize disaster response by combining **IoT, mobile devices, and AI-driven decision systems**. During earthquakes or similar emergencies, the platform collects real-time data from mobile phones, wearables, and distributed IoT sensors. This data is processed by **machine learning and deep learning models**, enabling autonomous decision-making to assist rescue teams in coordination and victim detection.  

### Key Features  
- **Multi-Sensor Fusion**: Integration of accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS, and audio signals from mobile and IoT devices.  
- **Edge/Cloud AI**: Lightweight models (CNN, LSTM, CRNN, GNN) deployed on **Raspberry Pi, mobile, and cloud servers** for real-time analysis.  
- **Crowdsensing**: Victim smartphones and wearables act as distributed data points in the network.  
- **Dynamic Sensor Networks**: Self-organizing wireless sensor networks for resilient communication in disaster zones.  
- **Decision Support**: Bayesian networks and reinforcement learning models support **routing, prioritization, and risk mapping** for rescue teams.  
- **Mapping & Visualization**: GIS-based dashboards provide live situational awareness for **AFAD and emergency responders**.  

### Research Context  
The project aligns with my **doctoral research**:  
- *Artificial Intelligence-Supported Real-Time Disaster Management with Multi-Sensor Fusion* (PhD, Kocaeli University, ongoing).  
- Supported by a **TÜBİTAK 1001 Grant**, integrating academic research with practical disaster-response applications.  

### Impact  
KURTAR has the potential to **save lives in the golden hours of disaster response**, by accelerating victim detection, reducing coordination delays, and enabling data-driven decision-making for national and international rescue teams.
